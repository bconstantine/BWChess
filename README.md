# BWChess
This project was done together with Willy Awan, Vincent Tamrin, and Junior Tanaya as a submission for National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Object Oriented Programming Class.

SFML API is used here for the GUI, which we do not own. We also do not own the sound and visuals used inside the program.
